# Simple Shell Project

Welcome to the Simple Shell Project, a hands-on learning experience that will help you explore the fundamentals of a Unix-like shell. This project covers various aspects of shell development, historical context, and essential Unix concepts. By the end of this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how shells work and their significance in the computing world.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of the following key concepts:

1. **Unix Origins:**
   - Learn about the designers and implementers of the original Unix operating system.

2. **History of Shells:**
   - Discover who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell.

3. **Programming Language Evolution:**
   - Understand the connection between the B programming language (predecessor to C) and shell development.

4. **Ken Thompson:**
   - Explore the significance of Ken Thompson in the development of Unix and shells.

5. **Shell Functionality:**
   - Learn how a shell operates, including its core functionalities.

6. **Process Management:**
   - Understand the concepts of Process ID (PID) and Parent Process ID (PPID).

7. **Environment Manipulation:**
   - Explore how to manipulate the environment of the current process.

8. **Function vs. System Call:**
   - Distinguish between functions and system calls in the context of shell development.

9. **Process Creation:**
   - Learn how to create new processes and manage them effectively.

10. **Main Function Prototypes:**
    - Understand the three prototypes of the `main` function in a shell program.

11. **Program Execution:**
    - Explore how the shell uses the `PATH` environment variable to locate and execute programs.

12. **Executing Programs:**
    - Learn how to execute other programs using the `execve` system call.

13. **Process Suspension:**
    - Understand how to suspend process execution until a child process terminates.

14. **EOF (End-of-File):**
    - Learn about the concept of "EOF" and its significance.

## Output

Your shell program should produce the same output as the `/bin/sh` shell for both normal and error cases. When printing errors, ensure that the name of the program is equivalent to `argv[0]`.

## List of Allowed Functions and System Calls

In this project, you are allowed to use the following functions and system calls:

- `access`
- `chdir`
- `close`
- `closedir`
- `execve`
- `exit`
- `_exit`
- `fflush`
- `fork`
- `free`
- `getcwd`
- `getline`
- `getpid`
- `isatty`
- `kill`
- `malloc`
- `open`
- `opendir`
- `perror`
- `read`
- `readdir`
- `signal`
- `stat` (__xstat)
- `lstat` (__lxstat)
- `fstat` (__fxstat)
- `strtok`
- `wait`
- `waitpid`
- `wait3`
- `wait4`
- `write`

Please refer to the specific man pages for each of these functions and system calls to understand their usage in greater detail.

Now that you have a clear overview of this Simple Shell Project, feel free to start exploring the world of shell development, Unix history, and process management. This project is designed to be a valuable learning experience that will deepen your understanding of shell programming and its historical context. Good luck with your shell development journey!
